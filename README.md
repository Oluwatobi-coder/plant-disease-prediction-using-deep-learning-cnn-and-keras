## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oluwatobi-coder/plant-disease-prediction-using-deep-learning-cnn-and-keras.git
cd plant-disease-prediction-using-deep-learning-cnn-and-keras
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧠 Model Training
If you want to retrain the model or experiment with the architecture:

1. Navigate to the `model_training_notebook/` directory.

2. Open the training notebook (e.g., via VS Code or any other IDE of choice).

3. Run the cells to train the model. The trained model will be saved to the `trained_model/` directory.

## 🌐 Running the Streamlit App
To interact with the model using the web interface locally:

1. Navigate to the `streamlit_app` directory:
```bash
cd streamlit_app
```
2. Run the Streamlit command:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app/plant_disease_prediction_app.py
```
3. Upload a plant leaf image to get the disease prediction and confidence score.

## 📊 Results

* **Accuracy and Loss Curves:** visualized in the `plant_disease_detection.ipynb` notebook in the `model_training_notebook` directory and saved in `model_results_images` folder.
